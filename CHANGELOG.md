Drupal Starshot with Lando
==========================

[v1.0](https://github.com/n00bsaiboth/drupal-starshot-with-lando) (2024-12-05)

I was inspired by Druid's blog post, ["Uu­si Dru­pal CMS vie si­säl­lön­hal­lin­nan uu­del­le ta­sol­le"](https://druid.fi/blogi/uusi-drupal-cms-vie-sisallonhallinnan-uudelle-tasolle/), and decided to create my own fork from it, with Lando. They already had support for DDEV.

I haven't used Drupal for a while now, it has been almost 9 months without it. So it's highly possible, that something doesn't work.

At least I can tell that my first installation, that is a private repository, I managed to get it working with SQLite, but in this fork, Drupal uses MariaDB.

It's also highly possible, that if I delete the SQLite version of the starshot project on my local, clone the repo again from the github and when I try to spin it up, I'm truly afraid that it doesn't work. So I will not delete that version from my local.

I haven't tested this MariaDB version either, so I'll do that next and tell what happens. Fingers crossed.
